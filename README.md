# Data Science Portfolio - Phung Tran (Sophie)

Welcome to my data projects repository! 🚀

This repository is a showcase of my work in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. It contains various projects that demonstrate my skills in:

🧠 Machine Learning: Predictive models, classification, clustering, and more. <br>
📊 Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and actionable insights using Python, and SQL. <br>
📈 Visualization: Creating clear and impactful visualizations with tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn <br>
🔗 End-to-End Solutions: Full pipeline projects, from data collection to deployment. <br>

Each project is well-documented, with a focus on:
- Problem Definition
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Model Development and Evaluation
- Insights and Business Impact

You’re welcome to browse through and share your feedback! 😊

In this project I have used survival analysis to study how the likelihood of the customer churn changes over time. I have also implementd a Random Forest model to predict the customer churn and deployed a model using flask webapp on Heroku.

The objective of this project is to analyze the 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users and predict which previously purchased item will be in user's next order. Customer segmentation and affinity analysis are also done to study user purchase patterns.



## Mini Projects

### Machine Learning
- [Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/genetic-algorithm.ipynb) : In this file, I have implemented simple genetic algorithm that finds out the list of numbers which equal to any specified number when summed together.
